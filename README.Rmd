# demopkg

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `demopkg` is to to provide some demonstrations of R fnctions and also vignettes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of demopkg from [GitHub](https://github.com/rccline/demopkg) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/rccline/demopkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(demopkg)
M <- make_data() ## basic example code

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

Use this code like this...
```{r cars}
plot(rnorm(100))  # put in examples of the code here
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
